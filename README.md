# OpenGD77FR
OpenGD77 Francedmr
This repo began as a fork of rogerclarkmelborune/OpenGD77, which has since been deleted. It contains the latest known publicly-released code.

# Project status
This repo has been established to maintain the code until a clear direction for the OpenGD77 project is re-established. PRs are welcome.

Current priorities include testing the firmware from this build and reworking how the CODEC portions of the original binary are incorporated into the firmware. Until this is addressed, distributing the firmware is problematic from a copyright and licensing perspective.

The firmware generated by this project includes binary code from the official Radioddity firmware. The CODEC from the original binary is re-used to avoid intellectual property infringement. Distributing the resulting binary is therefore problematic from a intellectual property law perspective.

# Building
Please see BUILD.md for toolchain and build instructions.
